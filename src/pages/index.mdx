<b>For OpenReview validators:</b> My school doesn't offer institution affiliation email for students, which is a common practice in China.
I can provide my student ID card if needed, along with transcriptions and other documents if further verification is required.
I'm going to submit some papers to OpenReview this year with peers, who is also a student at my school.
If you need to verify my identity, please contact me via email ([my personal email](mailto:7086cmd@gmail.com)).
