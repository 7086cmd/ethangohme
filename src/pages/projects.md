## Lightest

* [Github Repo](https://github.com/zhangzheheng12345/Lightest)

An extremely light, header-only but meanwhile strong, flexible and customizable C++ unit test library. (C++11 required)

The library includes all the basic features of a unit test library, such as test definitions, assertions, and pretty output formatting.

## FlowScript

* [Github Repo](https://github.com/zhangzheheng12345/flowscript)

An embed interpreter of a special functional language of **FlowScript** (created by myself) written in Go.

This is my largest project (still it's small and simple).
I started it for learning interpreter & compiler technology, practising Go, and for fun.

Here I put a short FlowScript program:

<!-- highlight FlowScript as Ruby -->
```ruby
def fibonacci a b begin
    add a b > echoln -
    add a b > smlr - 10000 > if - begin
        add a b > fibonacci b -
    end
end
echoln "fibonacci begins ..."
fibonacci 1 1
```

* [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/zhangzheheng12345/visual-brainfuck-web)
* Website at [visual-brainfuck-web.netlify.app](https://visual-brainfuck-web.netlify.app)

An online brainfuck interpreter with a real-time visual memory.

I am a lover of Brainfuck, so I started this project to debug Brainfuck easier.

This project is written in Vue3.
