An extremely light, header-only but meanwhile strong, flexible and customizable C++ unit test library. (C++11 required)

The library includes all the basic features of a unit test library, such as automatic test registration, assertions, and pretty output formatting.

Here is an instance of a test file using Lightest:

```cpp
#include "lightest/lightest.h"

TEST(Test) {
  REQ(1, ==, 1); // Pass
  REQ(1, ==, 2); // Fail
  SUB(SubTest) {
    SUB(SubSubTest) {
      REQ(1, ==, 1);
    }; // Semicolon required while defining sub tests
  };
}
```

Outputs go thus (should have pretty colors if your platform is Windows, MacOS or Linux):

```
 BEGIN  Test
   FAIL  test.cpp:5: REQ [1 == 2] failed
      ├──── ACTUAL:    1
      └── EXPECTED: == 2
   BEGIN  SubTest
     BEGIN  SubSubTest
     PASS   SubSubTest 1ms
   PASS   SubTest 2ms
 FAIL   Test 3ms
 ✕ FAILED ✕  5ms used
```

Outputs should be colorful if your platform is Windows, Linux, or MacOS.
