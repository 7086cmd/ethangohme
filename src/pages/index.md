title: Hi! I'm Zheheng Zhang!

I'm a beginner & lover of programming, and a junior high school student. I look forward to becoming a programmer in the future, so now I'm making efforts.

## Interests

Currently I'm interested in Go, C++, HTML & JavaScript & CSS & Typescript & Vue & Astro (in short that's front end tech), Python, Haskell, Brainfuck (just for fun) and dev tools making.

## About this page

This page is built using Astro, Vue, and UnoCSS. It's still in progress.
