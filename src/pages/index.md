# Hi!

# I'm Zheheng Zhang!

I'm a beginner & lover of programming, and a junior high school student.
I look forward to be a programmer in the future, so now I'm making efforts.

# Interests

Currently interested in Go, C++, HTML & JavaScript & CSS & Typescript & Vue & Astro (in short that's front end tech), Python, Haskell, Brainfuck (just for fun) and dev tools making.

## About this page

This page is built using Astro, Vue, and UnoCSS. It's still in progress. If you like this page, go to [GithHub repo of my personal website](https://github.com/zhangzheheng/zzhme) to take a look, star, or fork.
