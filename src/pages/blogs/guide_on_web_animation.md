I want to add some cool animation to my personal website, so start this interesting journey for exploring Web animation. Here are some of my sees and hears.

## Immediate Libraries for CSS Animation

Some animation libraries provide CSS animation which you can use immediately. They fit most of the occasions.

### Animation.css

- [Official Website](https://animation.style)

A CSS animation libraries, providing various in/out and transition CSS animation. It's quite smoothy and simple to use, and convenient to be integrated to popular Frameworks such as Vue. At its offcial website, you can preview different amimations the library provided.

Here is an example:

```html
<h1 class="animate__animated animate__bounce">To bounce!</h1>
```

### Use Atomic CSS Libraries

If you just want to add style to one or to elements, ~~as a person with OCD,~~ you will certainly feel uncomfortable to specially create a single class or id selector for it (or them). So here I recommend atomic CSS, which enabling you to add styles in the class list 'atomically', so that the expectation of CSS in HTML will be reached.

Here is an an instance of UnoCSS, and in fact most of the atomic CSS libraries shall be used smimlarly:

```html
<p class="c-red bg-gray-200 text-lg">
  Red, large paragraph with light gray background!
</p>
```

Popular CSS atomic CSS libraries include [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com), [Windi CSS](https://windicss.org), and [UnoCSS](https://uno.antfu.me). These libraries themselves contains some atomic CSS class for animation, such as `bounce` etc.

To furtherly speaking, I individually think UnoCSS is the best among three above, and it's used in my personal website. UnoCSS is an open source project created by [Anthony Fu](https://antfu.me). Compared to Tailwind CSS and Windi CSS, it is more flexible, powerful and fast. UnoCSS generates CSS on demand, is highly customizable, and can be integrated to Vite immediately. But the core of UnoCSS is just an engine for atomic CSS, so before use, to load some presets which are offcially provided is required (this is quite simple); meanwhile, since the core of UnoCSS is an engine, interfaces are exposed directly, which makes customizing and extending fairly easy.

Besides its document (link provided above), You can also look into Anthony Fu's blog [Reimagine Atomic CSS](https://antfu.me/posts/reimagine-atomic-css) or visit [GitHub repo of UnoCSS](https://github.com/unocss/unocss) to learn more about UnoCSS.

### Animista.net

- [Website](https://animista.net)

A CSS animation playground with plenty of smoothy preset animation. Parameters of the animations can be edited. You can copy the source code, or choose several animations and download the whole CSS file. However, using this in your project can lead to the inflation of CSS code, and directly putting CSS generated by machine but not relying upon NPM's ecosystem, this is obviously not a graceful solution.

One of my project: birthday count downer, uses Animista.net to add smoothy animations. You can visit [website of my birthday count downer](https://birthday-count-downer.netlify.app) to see an instance whose animations powered by Animista.net.

## Write CSS animation by hand? You need help from CSS preprocessors!

You can use `@keyframes` to write CSS animation by hand, details according to [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org). And when changing style of HTML elements, you can use `transition` to realize transtions.

But as we all know, `@keyframe` in CSS uses keyframe, but transitions between keyframes are completed by browsers linearly. So beautiful animation requires plenty of keyframes to make it smoothy. This stops some people, me included, writing CSS animation by hand. I finally discovered that to get help from CSS prerpocessors is the best choice.

Using loop, calculation, and function for animation curve defined, you can make CSS preprocessors to generating a long trail of keyframes which, so that animations can be extremely smoothy, meanwhile cause no inflation of CSS code. Popular CSS preprocessors include [SASS](https://sass-lang.com), [LESS](https://lesscss.org), and [Stylus](https://stylus-lang.com). Specially, LESS doesn't support loop by default, so you need to use recursion syntax instead.

Among three above, I individually recommend Stylus more, since it's very succinct flexible and strong. But to consider more about ecosystem, you may prefer SASS or LESS.

Here is an instance based on Stylus. The `div` should move right uniformly accelerated.

以下是一个基于 Stylus 的实例，`div`将会匀加速向右移动：

```html
<div class="box lengthen"></div>
```

```stylus
.box
  width: 10px
  height: 10px
  animation: lengthen 5s

@keyframes lengthen
  for i in 0..10
    {10% * i}
      transform: translate(i*i, 0)
```
